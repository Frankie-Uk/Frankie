        I attended <strong>St Peters Cathedral Anglican school </strong> Asaba, Delta state...( <em>2011-2015</em> ) It is both a day school and boarding 
        school. <br>My primary school experience was'nt really the best because it was an Anglican school and I am a 
        catholic so they were <br> really strict. When it came to my studies, I was'nt really the smartest but I still was'nt the worst. I am the playful
        type so I didnt <br> really care about my studies like that but I still ended up in top 15 out of 32. I had very few friends but 
        I remember being very close  <br> with my teachers. Overall, there were still some enjoyable moments and I have really good memories from there.

  The name of my secondary school is <strong>Noble Academy</strong> Asaba, Deta State...( <em>2015-2020</em> )It is a day 
  school. My academics is Junior Secondry <br> School(JSS) gradually started increasing compared to primary school because
  I ended up being among the top 5. But it slowly started decreasing <br> again as I advanced to Senior Secondary School
  (SSS).I usually end up in top 10 because the competion was much but regardless, I never strayed <br> from understandin 
  what I'm being taught. I am very grateful for my secondary school social experiences, be it making new and wonderful friends <br>
  or being verbally bullied, they all taught me something; That humans can be very loyal and supportive.. and also 
  how to clapback at people that <br> don't mean well for you. As for my academic exerience, The teachrs were nice and 
  they taught me well.
